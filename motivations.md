I do love working in therapy and having a private practice. It offers a rewarding and fulfilling experience when things go well. However, it is extremely draining to work with people all the time. When I am seeing enough clients to be making enough money to survive, I find I get burnt out quickly. I also don't like the pressure that puts on me to see more clients than I am comfortable each week and that I need them to keep coming. It has taken me a long time to decide to make the change but I would rather have a different primary career and income source while keeping a small private practice with a few clients a week on the side. This way it is only my passion for helping people that keeps me working in therapy and I can make adjustments as I need to. I can foresee this becoming complicated sometimes when my coding work may take me away from therapy further, but I think it is the overall right decision for me. The amount of money I will make in comparison is also a motivating factor. I can't believe that being a therapist does not pay better and maybe if one day things adjust and it becomes a better paying career, as it should be, I may make the switch back. At least after Turing, I will have the ability, skills and credentialing necessary to take either, or both paths if I want to.
